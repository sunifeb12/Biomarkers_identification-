To find out the common gene names between the DEG list and targets of differentially expressed miRNAs pulled out from MIRTARBASE database. 
The common genes will reflect that the targets of differentially expressed miRNAs are also differentially expressed 

Have to find any common gene names in between the two files.. 
Column E in 'mirtarbase_miR-1262_SRR926262'  and column B of 'DEGs_list_SRR926262'
